\part[6] Two large investment companies have each presented a MPF plan to the management of a corporation. To obtain employees' attitude toward the two investment plans, the personnel officer randomly selected 10 employees from the employee registry. Both investment plans were explained in detail to each employee in the sample. The employees were then asked to rate each plan on a ten-point Likert scale, with `1' indicating the plan is completely unacceptable; and `10' indicating it is perfectly acceptable. The recorded responses are shown in the table below:


\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Employee & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\

\question[20]
An experiment was performed to compare the abrasive wear of two different laminated materials. Twelve pieces of material 1 were tested by exposing each piece to a machine measuring wear. Ten pieces of material 2 were similarly tested. In each case, the depth of wear was observed. The samples of material 1 gave an average (coded) wear of 85 units with a sample standard deviation of 4, while the samples of material 2 gave an average of 81 with a sample standard deviation of 5. 

\begin{parts}
% ex 10.6
\part[10] Can we conclude at the $0.05$ level of significance that the abrasive wear of material 1 exceeds that of material 2 by more than 2 units? Assume the populations to be approximately normal with equal variances.
% ex 10.13

\section{Elective questions}

\begin{questions}
\question[10] A vote is to be taken among the residents of a town and the surrounding county to determine whether a proposed chemical plant should be constructed. The construction site is within the town limits, and for this reason many voters in the county believe that the proposal will pass because of the large proportion of town voters who favor the construction. To determine if there is a significant difference in the proportions of town voters and county voters favoring the proposal, a poll is taken. If 120 of 200 town voters favor the proposal and 240 of 500 county residents favor it, would you agree that the proportion of town voters favoring the proposal is higher than the proportion of county voters? Compute the p-value and use it to draw a conclusion at $\alpha=0.05$ level of significance.

\question[10] Let $\Phi(x)$ be the cdf of a standard normal random variable and let $X\sim N(0,1)$. Find $E(\Phi(X))$.
