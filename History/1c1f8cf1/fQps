Hi Prof Fung,

Hope all is well. I have sorted out my family issues and can now come to Canada. Specifically, my sister has now agreed to come back to Hong Kong if needed.

Do you think I can still come and be your student? I'm now just as eager to come to work with you as the first day I talked with you.

I'm aware that it's too late to come in September this year; I'll be more than happy to come in the Winter semester this year.

Thanks,
Wing
