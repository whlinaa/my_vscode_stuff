# research direction
- gather more data from wearables (heartbeats)
    - in order to predict diseases from the insured, we need more health data from them 
    - we need updated data from the user. For example, to predict the next policy year, the only thing that we know have changed is the age. This is not sufficient to build a predictive model. 
- use publicly available health data: https://towardsdatascience.com/healthcare-claims-data-for-predictive-analytics-cbffbc19cc5f
    - In addition to increasingly well-formulated sets of health status monitoring and electronic health record data, billions of rows of healthcare claims data is available in public and private datasets that are often very high-quality.
    - 
- disease date (20 yrs ago you had some disease, but some has recovered)
- have we used insured's claim data? (medical claims)
    - if so, is the claim digital or in paper form?
- 
 

claim compliance reviews: 索償合規性
- sometimes we are required to retain data for a certain period of time

# survival analysis (aka reliability analysis)
## terms in survival analysis
- remission (（疾病的）緩解期，減輕期): a period of time when an illness is less severe or is not affecting someone
    - Her cancer has been in remission for several years.
- the expected duration of time until one event occurs. Like the expected value of an exponential distribution
- proportion of people who will survive past a given time? (i.e., P(X>t) )
- with categorical variables, we use `Cox proportional hazards regression`, `Survival trees`, `Survival random forests`
- Censoring / Censored observation: Censoring occurs when we have some information about individual survival time, but we do not know the survival time exactly. The subject is censored in the sense that nothing is observed or known about that subject after the time of censoring. A censored subject may or may not have an event after the end of observation time.
- censoring: In statistics, censoring is a condition in which the value of a measurement or observation is only partially known. For example, suppose a study is conducted to measure the impact of a drug on mortality rate. In such a study, it may be known that an individual's age at death is at least 75 years (but may be more). Such a situation could occur if the individual withdrew from the study at age 75, or if the individual is currently alive at the age of 75. Censoring also occurs when a value occurs outside the range of a measuring instrument. For example, a bathroom scale might only measure up to 140 kilograms (310 lb). If a 160 kg (350 lb) individual is weighed using the scale, the observer would only know that the individual's weight is at least 140 kilograms (310 lb).
- survival function S(t) = P(X>t)
- mortality rate: Mortality rate, or death rate,[2]: 189, 69  is a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a particular population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time. Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1,000 individuals per year; thus, a mortality rate of 9.5 (out of 1,000) in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total.
- mortality: the number of deaths within a particular society and within a particular period of time
    - mortality rate: 死亡率
- morbidity: the morbidity of a disease is how many people have it in a particular population (發病（率）)
- common distribution used to model survival time: exponential, weibull, gamma, normal, log-normal, log-logistic
    - exponential model not a good fit for modelling human survival, since it's memoryless. 
- Three characteristics of survival analysis:
    - response variable (i.e., dependent variable) is the waiting time until the occurrence of a well-defined event
    - observations are censored, in the sense that for some units the event of interest has not occurred at the time the data are analyzed
    - there are predictors or explanatory variables whose effect on the waiting time we wish to assess or control

## hazard rate function (aka failure rate function)
- lambda(t) = f(t)/S(t), where f is pdf, S is survival function
- lambda(t) = given an object has survived t unit time, what is the instantaneous rate of occurrence of the event

## hazard ratio 
- In survival analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) is the ratio of the hazard rates corresponding to the conditions described by two levels of an explanatory variable. For example, in a drug study, the treated population may die at twice the rate per unit time of the control population. The hazard ratio would be 2, indicating higher hazard of death from the treatment.


## censoring and truncation 
- 
- Censoring / Censored observation: Censoring occurs when we have some information about individual survival time (i.e., response y), but we do not know the survival time exactly. The subject is censored in the sense that nothing is observed or known about that subject after the time of censoring. A censored subject may or may not have an event after the end of observation time.
    - Most survival analyses must consider a key analytical problem called censoring. In essence, censoring occurs when we have some information about individual survival time, but we don’t know the survival time exactly.
- for some units the event of interest has occurred and therefore we know the exact waiting time, whereas for others it has not occurred, and all we know is that the waiting time exceeds the observation time
- three reasons why censoring occurs
    - a person does not experience the event before the study ends;
    - a person is lost to follow-up during the study period;
    - a person withdraws from the study because of death (if death is not the event of interest) or some other reason (e.g., adverse drug reaction or other competing risk)
- `right censoring`: If only the lower limit l for the true event time T is known such that T > l, this is called right censoring. Right censoring will occur, for example, for those subjects whose birth date is known but who are still alive when they are lost to follow-up or when the study ends. We generally encounter right-censored data.
- `left censoring`: If the event of interest has already happened before the subject is included in the study but it is not known when it occurred, the data is said to be left-censored. 
- `interval censoring`: When it can only be said that the event happened between two observations or examinations, this is interval censoring.
- Left censoring occurs for example when a permanent tooth has already emerged prior to the start of a dental study that aims to estimate its emergence distribution. In the same study, an emergence time is interval-censored when the permanent tooth is present in the mouth at the current examination but not yet at the previous examination. Interval censoring often occurs in HIV/AIDS studies. Indeed, time to HIV seroconversion can be determined only by a laboratory assessment which is usually initiated after a visit to the physician. Then one can only conclude that HIV seroconversion has happened between two examinations. The same is true for the diagnosis of AIDS, which is based on clinical symptoms and needs to be confirmed by a medical examination.
- A RV $y$ is said to be truncated below if, for some threshold value c, the exact value of $y$ is known for all cases y > c, but unknown for all cases y<=c. 
- Truncation is similar to but distinct from the concept of statistical censoring. A truncated sample can be thought of as being equivalent to an underlying sample with all values outside the bounds entirely omitted, with not even a count of those omitted being kept. With statistical censoring, a note would be recorded documenting which bound (upper or lower) had been exceeded and the value of that bound. With truncated sampling, no note is recorded.
    - Usually the values that insurance adjusters receive are either left-truncated, right-censored, or both. For example, if policyholders are subject to a policy limit u, then any loss amounts that are actually above u are reported to the insurance company as being exactly u because u is the amount the insurance company pays. The insurer knows that the actual loss is greater than u but they don't know what it is. On the other hand, left truncation occurs when policyholders are subject to a deductible. If policyholders are subject to a deductible d, any loss amount that is less than d will not even be reported to the insurance company. If there is a claim on a policy limit of u and a deductible of d, any loss amount that is greater than u will be reported to the insurance company as a loss of {\displaystyle u-d}u-d because that is the amount the insurance company has to pay. Therefore, insurance loss data is left-truncated because the insurance company doesn't know if there are values below the deductible d because policyholders won't make a claim. The insurance loss is also right-censored if the loss is greater than u because u is the most the insurance company will pay. Thus, it only knows that your claim is greater than u, not the exact claim amount.

    - An attending physician statement (APS) is a report by a physician, hospital or medical facility who has treated, or who is currently treating, a person seeking insurance. In traditional underwriting, an APS is one of the most frequently ordered additional sources of medical background information. The APS is one of the more expensive underwriting requirements, as well as the most time consuming. It is usually completed only when a doctor has free time, as their primary focus is caring for patients. The underwriting cycle time is often severely hampered by the APS as it could take weeks or even months to obtain. Once obtained, it can be laborious to review and summarize as APS reports can be large documents containing an in-depth medical history information which may or may not be relevant.

## types of doctors
- https://www.verywellhealth.com/types-of-doctors-residents-interns-and-fellows-3157293
- `surgeon (外科醫生)`: a doctor who is specially trained to perform medical operations
- `physician (內科醫生)`: a medical doctor, especially one who has general skill and is not a surgeon
- `specialist (專科醫生)`: a doctor who has special training in and knowledge of a particular area of medicine
- `resident doctor`: After completing medical school, almost all doctors enter a residency program. While practicing independently is possible, the vast majority of physicians choose to pursue a residency for further training.
    -  Residency can range from an additional two years of education to an additional seven years of training, depending on the specialty. For example, a family practice residency would be two years of residency while a surgery residency may last five, seven, or more years.
- `attending doctor`: An attending physician has completed their training and is practicing independently in their chosen specialty. This term is typically used at teaching facilities to differentiate fully credentialed senior-level physicians from junior physicians who are still completing their higher education.
    - An attending is considered an expert in their field of medicine or surgery. These physicians are typically working at a facility that provides education to physicians and may play an active role in that education. An attending typically has their own practice in their specialty that may include teaching residents and fellows. An attending may also oversee the practice and education of medical students.
    - attending doctor can also mean 主診醫生
- `Fellows`: A fellow is a physician who has completed their residency and elects to complete further training in a specialty. The fellow is a fully credentialed physician who chooses to pursue additional training, the fellowship is optional and is not required to practice medicine, but is necessary for training in a subspecialty.

# underwriting
- https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriting.asp
- `underwriting` not only determines whether to accept the applicant's application, but also determine the `premium`, `exclusion`, and `riders`. 
- `underwriting` (核保): Insurance underwriters are professionals who evaluate and analyze the risks involved in insuring people and assets. Insurance underwriters establish pricing for accepted insurable risks. The term underwriting means receiving remuneration for the willingness to pay a potential risk.
    - If a company underwrites an insurance policy, someone's property, etc., that company has an agreement to pay out money in cases of damage or loss.
    - If a bank or other organization underwrites an activity, it gives it financial support and takes responsibility for paying any costs if it fails.
    - https://www.bupa.com.hk/tc/customer-care/underwriting/
    - when we apply for insurance, our application will go through a underwriting process, in which underwriters will assess your health, etc, to evaluate the premium for your insurance policy
- Sometimes, our underwriting team will suggest that a customer can be insured with an exclusion. That means the customer’s policy won’t cover specific medical condition(s). If a condition is excluded from the policy, then Bupa won’t pay for any claims and/or expenses related to that condition.
- In some cases, our underwriting team may suggest that a customer’s medical condition(s), say pre-existing medical condition(s), can be covered under the policy with medical loading. This means the customer will pay an additional fee to cover specific medical condition(s)
    - The medical loading fee is a fixed percentage based on the total policy premium. This percentage stays the same when the policy is renewed.

## when will underwriting occurs
- Bupa’s underwriting team will review your health information in these situations:
    - When you apply for a new policy
    - When you apply to reinstate your policy (i.e. apply to reinstate a lapsed policy)
    - When existing customers
    - add a new family member to their policy
    - add an Optional Benefit to their policy
    - lower their deductible or upgrade their policy
- After a policy has been issued, we may re-underwrite it in certain situations, such as when a customer’s place of residence changes.

## outcomes of underwriting process
- Standard: No exclusions or medical loading will be added to the policy.
- Decline: The insurance application isn’t successful. Bupa won’t issue you a health insurance policy.
- Exclusion: Exclusion(s) for certain medical condition(s) will be added to the policy.
- Medical loading (or premium loading): An additional premium will be charged for the policy based on the medical condition(s). It’s usually a fixed percentage, which will be applied to new and renewed policies.





# term rider
- term rider / insurance endorsement (附约，或附加条款): https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rider.asp
    - https://thelifetank.com/what-is-rider-in-life-insurance#:~:text=%E4%BA%BA%E5%AF%BF%E4%BF%9D%E9%99%A9%E5%90%88%E5%90%8C%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84,%E6%88%90%E4%B8%BA%E4%BF%9D%E9%99%A9%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8%E7%9A%84%E6%89%BF%E8%AF%BA%E3%80%82
    - An insurance rider is an adjustment or an add-on to a basic insurance policy. Riders are designed to provide additional benefit over the stated coverage in the basic policy. A rider is useful for tailoring an insurance policy to the precise needs of the insured entity.
    - In general sense: a statement that is added to what has already been said or decided, or an addition to a government bill (= a written plan for a law)
        - I should like to add a rider to the judgment of the court.
    - A rider is an insurance policy provision that adds benefits to or amends the terms of a basic insurance policy. Riders provide insured parties with additional coverage options, or they may even restrict or limit coverage. There is an additional cost if a party decides to purchase a rider. Most are low in cost because they involve minimal underwriting. A rider is also referred to as an insurance endorsement. It can be added to policies that cover life, homes, autos, and rental units.
    - A rider is an insurance policy provision that adds benefits to or amends the terms of a basic insurance policy to provide additional coverage.
    - Riders tailor insurance coverage to meet the needs of the policyholder.
    - Riders come at an extra cost—on top of the premiums an insured party pays.
    - Riders come in various forms, including long-term care, term conversion, waiver of premiums, and exclusionary riders.
    - In some cases, a policyholder may not be able to add a rider after the policy has been initiated.

## Term Conversion Rider
- Term life insurance provides coverage for a limited time, typically 10 to 30 years. Once the policy expires, the policyholder is not guaranteed new coverage at the same terms. The policyholder's medical condition may make it difficult or impossible to obtain another policy.
- A term conversion rider allows the policyholder to convert an existing term life insurance to permanent life insurance without a medical exam. This is typically favorable to young parents seeking to lock in coverage to protect their families in the future.


## Exclusionary riders
- restrict coverage under a policy for a specific event or condition. Exclusionary riders are mainly found in individual health insurance policies. For example, coverage can be restricted for a preexisting condition detailed in the policy provisions. 
- As of September 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibited exclusionary riders from being applied to children. Exclusionary riders have not been permitted in any healthcare insurance since 2014.
- An exclusion rider is an endorsement or provision in an insurance policy that lists the perils or hazards that the insurer will not cover.
- Policyholders can purchase supplemental policies to fill the coverage gaps caused by these riders.
- Policyholders should be aware of which perils or hazards their policy will not cover or they may face unexpected financial burdens from a non-covered loss.
- For instance, a home insurance policy will provide some coverage for water damage. However, if it has an exclusion rider for damage from burst pipes, then the policy will not provide protection or compensation for water damage caused by a pipe bursting.
- Certain kinds of flooding are also commonly excluded from homeowners and renters insurance policies. Those who purchase these policies need to carefully review any exclusion riders to make sure they understand what sorts of damages they will not be covered by the insurance policy and will, instead, have to be paid out of pocket.


# loading / medical loading / premium loading
- https://www.bupa.com.hk/en/customer-care/underwriting/s
- `loadings`: Loadings are additional premium due to the risks based on your health.
    - “Loading” is a term used in the insurance industry referring to the extra charge added to the subscription fee upon renewal due to previous claims made by the subscriber. Some people confuse this term with the yearly increase in subscription based on age or medical costs inflation. In many cases, if an individual made claims frequently, his renewal subscription will be adjusted with loading in addition to the yearly increase. He may find the policy becoming less and less affordable; eventually terminating the policy over time.
    - However, all Bupa individual health insurance schemes do not charge additional subscription because of claims. Bupa will guarantee your cover can be renewed for life. Bupa does not charge any loading regardless of how many claims were made or changes in your health.

    - score re: https://www.scor.com/en
- Insurers are legally required to maintain sufficient reserves to pay all potential claims from issued policies.
- Reinsurance is also known as insurance for insurers or stop-loss insurance. Reinsurance is the practice whereby insurers transfer portions of their risk portfolios to other parties by some form of agreement to reduce the likelihood of paying a large obligation resulting from an insurance claim.
- `ceding party`: The party that diversifies its insurance portfolio is known as the ceding party. 
- The party that accepts a portion of the potential obligation in exchange for a share of the insurance premium is known as the reinsurer.
- Reinsurance allows insurers to remain solvent by recovering some or all amounts paid to claimants. Reinsurance reduces the net liability on individual risks and catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses. The practice also provides ceding companies, those that seek reinsurance, the capacity to increase their underwriting capabilities in terms of the number and size of risks.
- According to the Insurance Information Institute, Hurricane Andrew caused $15.5 billion in damage in Florida in 1992, causing seven U.S. insurance companies to become insolvent.
- By covering the insurer against accumulated individual commitments, reinsurance gives the insurer more security for its equity and solvency by increasing its ability to withstand the financial burden when unusual and major events occur.
- Through reinsurance, insurers may underwrite policies covering a larger quantity or volume of risk without excessively raising administrative costs to cover their solvency margins. In addition, reinsurance makes substantial liquid assets available to insurers in case of exceptional losses.

# insurance terms
- 
- stop-loss: an instruction to a broker to sell shares if they go down to a particular price:
- group policy: Group Insurance health plans provide coverage to a group of members, usually comprised of company employees or members of an organization. Group health members usually receive insurance at a reduced cost because the insurer’s risk is spread across a group of policyholders. There are plans such as these in both the US and Canada.
    - Group members receive insurance at a reduced cost because the insurer’s risk is spread across a group of policyholders.
    - Plans usually require at least 70% participation in the plan to be valid. 
    - Premiums are split between the organization and its members, and coverage may be extended to members' families and/or other dependents for an extra cost.
    - Employers can enjoy favorable tax benefits for offering group health insurance to their employees.
    - Group insurance may offer life insurance, health insurance, and/or some other types of personal insurance.
- medical claim form: 醫療賠償申請書. Some sections are to be filled by attending doctors. 
    - https://www.aia.com.hk/en/help-and-support/individuals/health-care-claims/file-a-claim/how-to-file-a-claim/medical.html
- facility claim: Facility billing is insurance billing for hospitals, inpatient or outpatient clinics, and other offices such as ambulatory surgery centers. This insurance billing is not the same as billing for a regular doctor or specialist.
- physician claim:
- retail pharmacy claim: 
- place of service code: Physician and facility claims also contain an AMA place of service code describing the type of facility a service was performed in (i.e. emergency room, urgent care facility, physician’s office, etc.).
- Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS): 
- Current Procedural Terminology (CPT): 
- Sum Assured (保障額): refers to the protection amount provided by the insurance plan such as the death benefit amount
- `hospital benefit (住院保障計劃)`: This supplementary benefit is designed to alleviate the life insured's financial pressures while they stay in a hospital. If their regular income is interrupted during hospitalization, this supplementary benefit provides them with a daily cash benefit.
- `Risk premium`: A risk premium is the investment return an asset is expected to yield in excess of the risk-free rate of return. An asset's risk premium is a form of compensation for investors. It represents payment to investors for tolerating the extra risk in a given investment over that of a risk-free asset.
    - Think of risk premium as a form of hazard pay for your investments. An employee assigned dangerous work expects to receive hazard pay in compensation for the risks they undertake. It's similar with risky investments. A risky investment must provide the potential for larger returns to compensate an investor for the risk of losing some or all of their capital.
    - This compensation comes in the form of a risk premium, which is the additional returns above what investors can earn risk-free from investments such as a U.S. government security. The premium rewards investors for the prospect of losing their money in a failing business, and isn't actually earned unless the business succeeds.
- `insurance rate = premium rate = insurance premium`: An insurance rate is the exact amount of money that a person must pay to receive a specific amount of insurance coverage. Insurance rates are often categorized by monthly or yearly payments, but not always. 
    - An insurance rate is the amount of money necessary to cover losses, cover expenses, and provide a profit to the insurer for a single unit of exposure. Rates, as contrasted with loss costs, include provision for the insurer's profit and expenses.
    - Typically, the more insurance coverage a person would like to receive, the higher the insurance rates they will have to pay. Insurance rates also tend to be very different from one insurance category to the next.
    - The term "insurance rate" is used interchangeably with the term "premium rate." Premiums are just the costs associated with a particular insurance policy. Most policies require premiums to be paid in order to receive coverage.
- `Insurable interest`: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insurable-interest.asp#:~:text=Insurable%20interest%20is%20a%20type,financial%20loss%20or%20other%20hardships.
    - Insurable interest is a type of investment that protects anything subject to a financial loss. A person or entity has an insurable interest in an item, event or action when the damage or loss of the object would cause a financial loss or other hardships. To have an insurable interest a person or entity would take out an insurance policy protecting the person, item, or event in question. The insurance policy would mitigate the risk of loss if something happens to the asset—like becoming damaged or lost.
- `insurer`: The company that provides insurance coverage and services on a policy.
- `policyholder`: owner of the policy. The one with the power to change beneficiary. This person may or may not be the one who pays the premium
- `insured (投保人)`: this person can't be changed. The policy premium is based on this person. 
- `payor`: Someone who pays for the insurance.
- `life insured`: it could be different from the policyholder, since you can buy the insurance for someone else. 
- `beneficiary`: This is the person who would receive any insurance benefits in case the policy holder was to pass away while on the insurance plan.
    - in life insurance, my mother is the beneficiary, but I am the policyholder/insured.
- `policyholder vs insured vs beneficiary`: these three people can all be different! 
- `waiting period`: E.g.: waiting three months before claiming physio benefits on health insurance
    - `length of waiting period` and `premium` are inversely correlated.
- `indemnification (verb: indemnify)`: The act of compensating for a loss.
- `deductible, Excess` (保險）扣除條款，免賠額,自負額 （指保險單內規定保險購買人在意外發生時自行承擔的某一數額的損失）: a part of the cost of an accident, injury, etc. that you agree to pay yourself when you buy insurance
    - Customers can lower insurance premiums by taking higher deductibles.
    - 免賠額，顧名思義，是免賠的額度。指由保險人和被保險人事先約定，損失額在規定數額之內，被保險人自行承擔損失，保險人不負責賠償的額度。因為免賠額能消除許多小額索賠，損失理賠費用就大為減少，從而可以降低保險公司的經營成本，同時降低被保險人要繳納的保費。所以免賠額條款在財產、健康和汽車保險中得到廣泛使用。
    - excess is the amount we agree to pay the insurer when we make a claim 
    - we can often choose the excess amount. Excess and premium are inversely correlated. 
- `co-pay`: Like a deductible, this is the amount of money you must pay out of pocked before the insurance company begins to pay for your eligible expenses. Typically this is required instead of a deductible or coinsurance, and requires you to pay a set fee for a specific visit.
- `coinsurance`: Coinsurance is a percentage of what the insurance will pay to cover your health care cost after any deductibles or copays have been met.
    - If you have an insurance policy with a 80% coinsurance and a medical bill of $1,000, the insurance will pay 80% or $800 and your share of the cost would be 20% or $200 (assuming there is no deductible or copay on the plan).
- `provider network (aka in-network provider)`: a group of medical providers that have contracted with the insurance company to provide health care services. In-network providers typically charge less for the same service compared to non-network providers, so using an in-network provider can save you money and they will usually accept direct payment from your insurance company.
- `Usual, Reasonable and Customary`: Usual, Reasonable and Customary (also known as URC) is the average cost for a particular treatment in a particular geographic area. It is the amount that insurance companies use to describe the limit on how much they will pay for covered expenses.
    - If most providers usually charge $5,000 for a particular procedure in Chicago, the insurance company will not pay a doctor $10,000 for the same procedure. Instead, they will limit their payment amount to "Usual Reasonable and Customary" - in this example, $5,000.
- `Emergency Medical Evacuation`: provides medically necessary transportation to the nearest qualified medical facility, not necessarily your home country.
- `Repatriation of Remains`: On most insurance plans, repatriation of remains covers the cost of returning the insured’s body back to their home country in case of death.
- `cancellation of insurance`: (退保) = discontinuing to give money to the insurance company
- `sum insured`: Sum insured is the amount of money that an insurance company is obligated to cover in the event of a covered loss. This term is commonly associated with homeowner's or property insurance but can also apply to other types of insurance.
    - The sum insured correlates directly to the amount of premium you pay, but not always to the property's actual value or asset insured. If the sum insured is less than the replacement value or required amount to rebuild, it is often referred to as underinsurance.
    - The amount you will receive from life insurance companies in the case of contract maturity or pass away (Depending on the policy conditions) 
    - https://www.scb.co.th/en/personal-banking/stories/sum-insured-and-premium-is-different-words.html
    - insurance premium and sum insured are positively correlated 
- `(insurance) premium 保費`: The amount paid to the life insurance company to purchase coverage by paying in installments may be monthly or yearly until the end of the contract (As agreed in the terms of payment of premiums). Normally, insurance premiums will have the same amount every installment until the end of the contract.
    - This is the actual cost of your insurance plan. Keep in mind that the higher the premium, the higher your coverage and thus, the less you will have to pay in medical bills throughout the year.
    - usually, pay per month or per year
    - An insurance premium is the amount of money an individual or business pays for an insurance policy. Insurance premiums are paid for policies that cover healthcare, auto, home, and life insurance.
- `coverage received` = money received from insurance policy
- `critical illness double benefit` (CID): 
- `lifetime health protector` (LHP): 
- `whole life medicare` (WLM): 
- `occupational loading premiums`: a flat extra premium in dollars per thousand sum insured
- `participating policy` (分紅保單) / with-profits policy: Usually a life insurance policy, in particular WL. A participating policy enables you, as a policyholder, to share the profits of the insurance company. These profits are shared in the form of bonuses or dividends. It is also known as a with-profit policy. In non-participating policies, the profits are not shared and no dividends are paid to the policyholders.
    - A participating policy is an insurance contract that pays dividends to the policy holder. Dividends are generated from the profits of the insurance company that sold the policy and are typically paid out on an annual basis over the life of the policy. Most policies also include a final or terminal payment that is paid out when the contract matures. Some participating policies may include a guaranteed dividend amount, which is determined at the onset of the policy. A participating policy is also referred to as a "with-profits policy."
    - The dividend received by the policyholder can be used in several different ways. First, the policyholder can apply the dividend proceeds to the insurance policy's premium payment. Second, the dividend can be kept with the insurance as a deposit in order to generate interest much like a regular savings account. Finally, the policyholder can simply receive the dividend payment in cash, much like a dividend payment on a stock
    - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/participation_policy.asp
    - if the policy in question is a life insurance, then 
        - Guaranteed life insurance protection
        - Guaranteed cash value (applicable to eligible Manulife insurance products only)
        - Annual dividends and / or terminal bonus
- `down payment`: 手期
- two approaches to term life insurance premium:
    - bowtie: parameter: sum assured.
        - each year, the premium increases. No need to choose benefit/premium term. 
        - premium is independent of how many times you make a claim 
        - charged automatically each month by credit 
    - blue: parameters: sum assured. premium term
        - the cost to be paid each month is fixed.
- `critical illness` (CI): 
- Straight-Through Processing (STP): Straight-through processing is an automated process done purely through electronic transfers with no manual intervention involved. Its popular uses are in payment processing as well as the processing of securities trades. Any company involved with straight-through processing will need to have the necessary systems and technical networking in place to facilitate STP efficiency.
    - is a method used by financial companies to speed up financial transactions by processing without manual intervention (straight-through).
- Mortality Risk: Mortality risk is the risk that an insurance company can suffer financially because too many of their life insurance policyholders die before their expected lifespans.
- `mutual insurance company` (相互保险公司): A mutual insurance company is an insurance company that is owned by policyholders. The sole purpose of a mutual insurance company is to provide insurance coverage for its members and policyholders, and its members are given the right to select management. Mutual insurance companies make investments in portfolios like a regular mutual fund, with any profits returned to members as dividends or a reduction in premiums. Federal law, rather than state law, determines whether an insurer can be classified as a mutual insurance company.
    - A mutual insurance company is an insurance company owned entirely by its policyholders. Any profits earned by a mutual insurance company are either retained within the company or rebated to policyholders in the form of dividend distributions or reduced future premiums. In contrast, a stock insurance company is owned by investors who have purchased company stock; any profits generated by a stock insurance company are distributed to the investors without necessarily benefiting the policyholders.
    - An insurance company owned by its policyholders is a mutual insurance company.
    - Mutual insurance companies are not listed on stock exchanges, but if they eventually decide to be, they are "demutualized."
    - Mutual insurance companies are not traded on stock exchanges, therefore their investment strategy avoids the pressure of having to reach short-term profit targets and can operate as best suited to its members with the goal of long-term benefits. As a result, they invest in safer, low-yield assets. However, `because they are not publicly traded, it can be more difficult for policyholders to determine how financially solvent a mutual insurance company is, or how it calculates dividends it sends back to its members.`
    - When a mutual insurance company switches from member-owned to being traded on the stock market, it is called “demutualization,” and the mutual insurance company becomes a stock insurance company. This shift may result in policyholders gaining shares in the newly floated company. Most often this is done as a form of raising capital. Stock insurance companies can raise capital by distributing shares, *whereas mutual insurance companies can only raise capital by borrowing money or increasing rates*.
- `mutual fund`: a service where financial experts invest the money of many people in many different companies
- `Mutual Life-Assurance Company`: A life insurance company owned by its own policyholders. That is, policyholders elect the board of directors, and profits, if any, are distributed to policyholders each year in proportion to their individual exposures to the company. Many insurance companies are structured in this way.
- `annuities`（通常指一直付到某人死亡的）年金；年金保險；年金保險投資
    - a fixed amount of money paid to someone every year, usually until their death, or the insurance agreement or investment that provides the money that is paid
    - An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company in which you make a lump-sum payment or series of payments and, in return, receive regular disbursements, beginning either immediately or at some point in the future.
    - Annuities are insurance contracts that promise to pay you regular income immediately or in the future—the latter is known as a deferred annuity.
    - You can buy an annuity with a lump sum or a series of payments.
    - Annuities come in three main varieties—fixed, variable, and indexed—each with its own level of risk and payout potential.
    - The income you receive from an annuity is taxed at regular income tax rates, not long-term capital gains rates, which are usually lower.
- difference between `life insurance` and `annuity`
    - At first glance, permanent life insurance policies and annuity contracts exhibit polar opposite goals. While life insurance seeks to provide an individual's family with a lump-sum fiscal payout when that individual dies, annuities act as safety nets by providing individuals with a lifetime of guaranteed income streams. Both products are often marketed as *tax-deferred* alternatives to traditional stock and bond investments. They each also have high expenses that can blunt investment returns.
- `tax deferred`: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxdeferred.asp
    - Tax-deferred status refers to investment earnings—such as interest, dividends, or capital gains—that accumulate tax-free until the investor takes constructive receipt of the profits.
    - e.g.,: any interest you receive is taxable and you should report it as interest received.
    - Generally speaking, when the beneficiary of a life insurance policy receives the death benefit, this money is not counted as taxable income, and the beneficiary does not have to pay taxes on it.
- `insurance policy`: A contract detailing an insurance policy and outlining what risks are insured, what insurance premiums are to be paid by the policyholder, what deductibles prevail, and all the details associated with a policy.
    - The contents of an insurance contract. The policy describes the specific types of coverage (life, health, etc.), the restrictions that apply, and the applicable deductibles and premiums. Only the insurer makes legally enforceable promises in an insurance policy: the insurance company cannot legally compel the insured person to pay his/her premiums, but the insured person can sue to compel the insurer to provide coverage if it does not do so. All insurance policies, however, include a provision allowing the insurer to refuse coverage if the insured person does not pay the premiums.
- `Disability Insurance`: As its name suggests, disability insurance is a type of insurance product that provides income in the event that a policyholder is prevented from working and earning an income due to a disability.
- `disability income insurance`
    - Disability income (DI) insurance provides supplementary income in the event an illness or accident results in a disability that prevents the insured from working at their regular employment. Benefits are usually paid monthly so the insured can maintain a comparable standard of living and pay recurring expenses.
- `long term care insurance`
    - Long-term care (LTC) insurance is coverage that provides nursing-home care, home-health care, and personal or adult daycare for individuals age 65 or older or with a chronic or disabling condition that needs constant supervision. LTC insurance offers more flexibility and options than many public assistance programs, such as `Medicaid`.
- `Medicare`: a government service in the US that allows people aged 65 and over to receive medical treatment.
- `Medicaid`: a government service in the US that allows poor people to receive medical treatment.

- UL, WL, TL: universal life, whole life, term life 
- `term life (TL) insurance / pure life insurance 定期型人壽保險`: Term life insurance, also known as pure life insurance, is a type of life insurance that guarantees payment of a stated death benefit if the covered person dies during a specified term. Once the term expires, the policyholder can either renew it for another term, convert the policy to permanent coverage, or allow the term life insurance policy to terminate.
    - no saving components
    - the premium per month/year can be variable, and usually is increasing (e.g., Blue term life scheme)
- `whole life (WL) 儲蓄型人壽保險/永久壽險/終身保險`: If you buy a whole life insurance policy from a mutual insurance company, you may receive annual dividend payments on your policy. These depend upon the profitability of the insurance company that particular year and are not guaranteed. However, some mutual companies have track records of delivering dividend payments virtually every year with policyholders. Dividends can be reinvested into your policy to help build cash value faster. Over time, this can help grow your cash value account.
- `universal life (UL) insurance 萬能型人壽保險`: is permanent life insurance with an investment savings element and low premiums that are similar to those of term life insurance. Most UL insurance policies contain a flexible-premium option. However, some require a single premium (single lump-sum premium) or fixed premiums (scheduled fixed premiums).
    - https://www.manulife.com.hk/en/individual/products/life/life-protection/universal-life.html
    - While universal life does enable you to benefit from interest rates when they’re working in your favor (and lose value when they’re not), in general, you do not receive dividend payments from the insurance company. 
    - 與傳統的終身壽險相比，這種類型的保險比較靈活，使保單持有人可以獲得最低利率，並能選擇保費支付的時間表。現金價值可以隨著價值的增長而藉入。
    - 這種保險比較靈活，保單所有人可以在任何時間繳費，費用可多可少，但要達到最低的交費水平。它也有現金值，即所交費用和獲利減去保險費用和收費。 此類保險可保證理賠金，但現金值不能保證。 
    - https://www.ccyp.com/ccypContents?content_id=100344
- `permanent life insurance`: both `WL` and `UL` are permanent life insurance! For the rest of the insured's life. In fact, usually until 100 only.
    - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/permanentlife.asp
    - Permanent life insurance is an umbrella term for life insurance policies that do not expire. Typically, permanent life insurance combines a death benefit with a savings portion.
    - The two primary types of permanent life insurance are whole life and universal life. Whole life insurance offers coverage for the full lifetime of the insured, and its savings can grow at a guaranteed rate. Universal life insurance also offers a savings element in addition to a death benefit, but it features different types of premium structures and earns based on market performance.
    - Unlike term life insurance, which promises payment of a specified death benefit for a specific period of years, permanent life insurance lasts the lifetime of the insured (hence, the name), unless nonpayment of premiums causes the policy to lapse. Permanent life insurance premiums go toward both maintaining the policy’s death benefit and allowing the policy to build cash value. The policy owner can borrow funds against that cash value or, in some instances, withdraw cash from it outright to help meet needs such as paying for a child’s college education or covering medical expenses.
- `TL vs WL`: https://naweeklytimes.com/2017/08/31/ul%E5%A5%BD%E9%82%84%E6%98%AFwl%E5%A5%BD%EF%BC%9F/
    - https://naweeklytimes.com/2017/08/31/ul%E5%A5%BD%E9%82%84%E6%98%AFwl%E5%A5%BD%EF%BC%9F/
    - both have saving components
    - WL costs a guaranteed level amount of money each month
    - WL cash values are guaranteed
    - WL potentially provides dividends. Almost 99% of the time
    - WL: insurer guarantees profit margin > 0. UL: can be negative. 
    - WL must have investment component, whereas UL may or may not 
    - UL cash values and premiums can fluctuate
    - UL does not benefit from dividend payments
    - UL provides more flexibility in payments
    - WL: investment controlled by insurer. UL: investment controlled by the policyholder. Therefore, for investment layman, WL is better than UL.
- Indexed universal life (指數型人壽保險): 這種類型的保單允許持有人根據獨立財務指數的表現來選擇以固定利率或浮動利率投資的保單百分比- 其中最受歡迎的是不計股息的股票指數。
- Variable universal life (投資型萬能人壽保險): 比其他保險政策更加靈活，這種類型的保單增加了投資的機會，讓持有人可以投資保單一部分的保費於股票，債券和其他基金。VUL有可能獲得更高的回報，但如果投資價值下降也會有損失。對於計劃長期保留保單的持有人來說，這是最好的選擇。
- two ways of paying for life insurance:
    - pay all fees in a set period of time
    - pay as you go 
- To understand the purpose of life insurance, we need to keep the following important points in mind.
    - Life insurance does not provide protections for the insured.
    - The beneficiaries can be the insured’s spouse and children, the parents, or anyone who has an insurable interest on the insured.
    - Protection type life insurance is an affordable risk management tool which protects beneficiaries from the insured’s premature death.
    - An appropriate life insurance product can also be used as an investment vehicle for retirement.
- four types of life insurance:
    - Term life insurance
    - Whole life insurance
    - Universal life insurance
    - Variable life insurance
    - These products may further be divided into participating (with dividends) and non-participating (without dividends). 
- 定期人壽保險 = term life insurance
    - 供款隨年齡增加   
- 終身人壽保險分別 = whole life insurance
    - 供款一般固定不變
- 保費方面，定期人壽保險遠比儲蓄人壽保險便宜。以HK$100萬保額的保單為例，坊間壽險保費一般為約HK$100至HK$200，儲蓄人壽保險可貴逾10倍，投保前宜認真考慮個人需要及供款能力。
- 儲蓄人壽保險: 
- 當保單到期時，投保人可選擇續保、轉換其他保單、或讓保單終止。
- 終身人壽保險一般可保障受保人至100歲，以定期人壽保障很多只保障至65歲，驟看前者似乎較周全，但從家庭財務狀況角度考慮，大多數人最需要人壽保障的時候，應為由成家立室至退休時，即約20多歲至60多歲。隨着年紀增長，子女畢業及財政獨立，按揭貸款亦已還清，身故賠償對家庭經濟的重要性降低。
- 當然，這並不代表人到老年後，對保險的需要會減少，相反，人難免伴隨歲月流逝而病痛漸多，必然加重醫療開支，但這部份的需要卻不是人壽保險可以覆蓋，這時你更需要的可能是醫療保險、危疾保障等產品。
- 人壽保險是長期的產品，故保險業監管局規定保險公司必須對壽險產品設冷靜期，一般為投保人收到保單或投保通知書後計起的21天。在冷靜期內，投保人可重新考慮投保決定，萬一改變主意，投保人可取消保單並獲發還保費。購買人壽保險時，記得清解了解你的權利。
- 用一個簡單的比喻，定期壽險像租樓，而終身壽險則似買樓。前者開支便宜、具靈活性，但若期滿後不續約，就不再享有保障；後者昂貴得多，但供滿後可永久受到保障，而且保單具現金價值及紅利。
- 危疾保險: 購買危疾保險後，如受保人患上嚴重疾病，其嚴重性及危急性都必須是危及生命，並符合保單條款列明的危疾定義，受保人就會得到一筆賠償。 在購買危疾保險時，保單上一定會列明保障的疾病範圍，常見危疾包括癌症、心臟病、中風等，同時條款會列明對每種疾病的危疾定義，例如確診不同期數的癌症，可影響受投人是否合資格獲賠償以及賠償的金額。
- 儲蓄保險: 儲蓄這個理財觀念很多現代人都知道，但是真正能自律完成的卻是當中的少數，坊間有不同類型的儲蓄產品助消費者更好地管理自己的財富，其中蓄儲保險是常見的選擇之一，而最近常被提及的延期年金，則是蓄儲保險的一種。
    - 購買儲蓄保險主要是希望將來拿回一定的回報，而儲蓄保險除了有儲蓄功能外，都帶有一定的保障成份，最常見的是身故賠償，如在供款期間受保人身故，受益人可以獲得投保時的保障額加紅利時賠償。
- 消費型保險(純保障保險): 消費型保險是指不含儲蓄成分、不具現金價值的保險，即使投保人在受保期間未有提交過任何索償申請，也不能拿回已繳保費。
-  現時市面上最常見的消費型保險分別有自願醫保、意外保險、危疾保險、定期人壽保險、旅遊保險、海外留學保險等
- Terminal Dividend: 終期紅利
- Terminal Bonus: 終期紅利
- 謬誤一：消費型保險不保證續保？: 比如說，Bowtie自願醫保雖然為消費型，客戶每月繳交保費，但由於合約列明「保證續保至 100 歲」，所以除非投保人主動退保，否則保險公司不能因為其年齡或身體狀況的轉變而拒保，直至投保人年屆 100 歲為止。 
- 消費型保險的最大優勢就是靈活性高，投保人可以因應個人需要，向公司申請調低保額，從而令保費下降至可接受的水平。


### example of life insurance
- in bowtie, is the monthly fee fixed??? If the first month is $90, then it will be $90 forever???
Calculation method
Your monthly premium is constituted of three parts:

The base premium is based on the following factors:

1. Age

2. Gender

3. Smoking habits(if applicable)

4. Occupation

5. The insurance plan of your choice

Loadings are additional premium due the risks based on your health.

A loading = base premium * percentage

A loading is not a fixed amount but a percentage of your base premium. As the base premium will increase with age, the amount of loadings will increase accordingly as well.

Example 1

1. Insured A has a base premium of HK$200 per month for the first year.

2. Insured A is diagnosed with high blood pressure.

3. The loading required for high blood pressure is 25% of the base premium.

4. Therefore, the loading is 25% of HK$ 200, which is HK$ 50

5. The monthly premium for the proposed insured A is HK$ 200 + HK$ 50 for the first year, which is a total of HK$ 250.

Loadings will take into account the severity of the disease

The more severe the disease is, the higher its loading will be.

Example 2

1. Insured B has a base premium of HK$200 per month for the first year.

2. Insured B is diagnosed with high blood pressure and needs to take three types of medicine daily.

3. The loading required for this type of high blood pressure is 50% of the base premium.

4. Therefore, the loading is 50% of HK$ 200, which is HK$ 100

5. The monthly premium for the proposed insured B is HK$ 200 + HK$ 100 for the first year, which is a total of HK$ 300.

Not all diseases will lead to loadings. In fact, minor illnesses may not have any loadings at all.

Each disease has its own independent loading

Example 3

1. Insured C has a base premium of HK$200 per month for the first year.

2. Insured C is diagnosed with high blood pressure and heart disease.

3. The loading required for high blood pressure is 25% of the base premium.

4. The loading required for heart disease is 50% of the base premium.

5. Therefore, the loading for high blood pressure is 25% of HK$ 200, which is HK$ 50, whereas the loading for heart disease is 50% of HK$ 200, which is HK$ 100.

6. The monthly premium for the proposed insured C is HK$ 200 + HK$ 50 + HK$ 100 = HK$ 350.

The Insurance Authority (IA) collects the premium levies from policy holders via the insurance companies. Levy does not constitute a part of the premium. Learn more

How levy works: levy = (base premium + loading) * a levy rate

The levy rate and the annual levy cap for each policy are detailed in below.

Phase 1 (1st January, 2018 to 31st March, 2019): 0.04% (levy cap:HK$40)

Phase 2 (1st April, 2019 to 31st March, 2020): 0.06% (levy cap:HK$60)

Phase 3 (1st April, 2020 to 31st March, 2021): 0.085% (levy cap:HK$85)

Phase 4 (from 1st April, 2021 onwards): 0.1% (levy cap:HK$100)





## Insurtech
- refers to the use of technology innovations designed to squeeze out savings and efficiency from the current insurance industry model. Insurtech is a combination of the words “insurance” and “technology,” inspired by the term fintech.
- The belief driving insurtech companies and investments by venture capitalists in the space is that the insurance industry is ripe for innovation and disruption. Insurtech is exploring avenues that large insurance firms have less incentive to exploit, such as offering ultra-customized policies, social insurance, and using new streams of data from Internet-enabled devices to dynamically price premiums according to observed behavior.
- Insurance is an old business, one of the oldest financial businesses and it tends to favor those with deep pockets and long experience in the market. Traditionally, broad actuarial tables are used to assign policy seekers to a risk category. The group is then adjusted so enough people are lumped together to ensure that, overall, the policies are profitable for the company.
- This approach does, of course, result in some people paying more than they should be based on the basic level of data used to group people. Among other things, insurtech is looking to tackle this data and analysis issue head-on. Using inputs from all manners of devices, including GPS tracking of cars to the activity trackers on our wrists, these companies are building more finely delineated groupings of risk, allowing products to be priced more competitively.
- In addition to better pricing models, insurtech startups are testing the waters on a host of potential game-changers. These include using deep learning trained artificial intelligence (AI) to handle the tasks of brokers and find the right mix of policies to complete an individual’s coverage.
- There is also interest in the use of apps to pull disparate policies into one platform for management and monitoring, creating on-demand insurance for micro-events like borrowing a friend's car, and the adoption of the peer-to-peer model to both create customized group coverage and incentivize positive choices through group rebates.

### criticism of insurtech
- Although many of these innovations are long overdue, there are reasons why the incumbent insurance companies are so reluctant to adapt. Insurance is a highly regulated industry with many layers of jurisdictional legal baggage to deal with. As such, the major companies have survived this long by being incredibly cautious, which has made them shy away from working with any startups—let alone startups in their own, very stable industry.
- This is a bigger problem than it sounds, as many of the insurtech startups still require the help of traditional insurers to handle underwriting and manage catastrophic risk. That said, as more insurtech startups garner consumer interest with a refined model and a user-friendly approach, they may find that the incumbent players warm to the idea of insurtech and become interested in buying up some of the innovation.

### what AI can do to insurance field
- https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/artificial-intelligence-meets-the-insurance-industry/
- Pricing: One of the most promising ways AI can improve the insurance industry is around pricing. With AI, insurance companies can price their policies more competitively and personalize them for each customer. For example, a home insurance company could use AI to get information about a person’s geographical location, marital status and likelihood of filing a claim to set premiums based on the defining criteria.
- Claim handling: Insurance companies spend a lot of money on claims personnel, and insurance prices are often marked up to account for case-solving. Using AI, an insurance company could reduce their hiring spend by automating many of the time consuming processes around claims management and payouts. The time needed for processing claims could reduce from several days to hours or even minutes. It would also allow insurers to provide more customized contracts for customers based on their unique circumstances.
- However, using AI is an effective way to detect fraud and prevent risk. Using AI can help insurance companies spot abnormalities in claims data and identify false information that customers use to get a lower premium or bigger claim payout


## very few insurance company actually invests in insurance tech
- However, despite these emerging trends, a disconnect exists between the amount of disruption perceived and insurers’ willingness to invest to defend against and/or take advantage of the innovation: 43% of the industry players claim they have FinTech at the heart of their corporate strategies, but only 28% explore partnerships with FinTech companies and even less than 14% actively participate in ventures and/or incubator programs.
