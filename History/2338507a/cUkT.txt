Dear Sir/Madam,

It is with great pleasure that I write this reference letter in support of Ching On Lo's application for a faculty position at your esteemed university.

I have had the privilege of knowing Lo for eleven years, initially as his student at the College of Professional and Continuing Education (CPCE) of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) from 2011 to 2013, and subsequently as his colleague at CPCE since 2017. Currently, I am employed as a Data Scientist at MassMutual Financial Group, while also maintaining a part-time Lecturer position at CPCE. I had the fortune of attending two of his outstanding courses at CPCE, namely Linear Algebra and Applied Statistical Methods. Additionally, I am honored to have co-taught three mathematics courses alongside him at the same institution.

In simple terms, Lo is the most dedicated and selfless educator I have encountered, not only at CPCE but throughout my entire academic journey. His significant contributions to my education, professional development, and research pursuits have inspired me to take great pride in providing this reference letter.

Lo possesses a remarkable gift for teaching. His classes were consistently engaging and accessible, largely due to his exceptional clarity in content delivery, meticulous preparation of course materials, and comprehensive understanding of mathematics. He employed a truly effective teaching method by explaining mathematical concepts from multiple perspectives (e.g., geometric, algebraic, and computational), which greatly facilitated my comprehension of new concepts. Lo's passion for math is evident in his teaching, and his enthusiasm is so infectious that it inspires his students to share his excitement.

Beyond his outstanding teaching abilities, Lo is a warm and approachable individual who is always willing to lend an ear. Regardless of the circumstances in my life or work, I can confidently approach him for stimulating conversation, valuable advice, or simply a friendly chat.

Though I was just one of the thousands of students he taught during my time at CPCE, Lo consistently made the effort to provide assistance. As I progressed through my undergraduate and graduate studies, he continued to offer unwavering support and guidance in overcoming both technical and personal challenges. His steadfast encouragement has undoubtedly shaped me into the person I am today.

Having collaborated with Lo for over four years now, I continue to admire his genuine dedication to helping students. In order to accommodate learners from diverse backgrounds and majors, he designs a range of supplementary learning activities (including learning circles, math enrichment workshops, additional classes, and a math learning center) to support students struggling with mathematical concepts or those seeking to delve deeper into the subject. Recognizing the challenges faced by many CPCE students in mastering calculus, Lo authored a textbook titled Calculus Done Right, specifically tailored for the CPCE curriculum. He consistently updates course materials, addresses students' inquiries, and refines his teaching methods, often at the expense of his personal time.

In summary, Lo is a compassionate, responsible, patient, diligent, and amiable educator who consistently prioritizes the needs of his students. I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to have learned from him and benefited from his guidance. When asked why he seldom takes time off, his response encapsulates his dedication: "I always feel like I'm on vacation every single day because I'm doing what I'm most passionate about." I cannot think of a more deserving candidate for the position, and I wholeheartedly offer my strongest recommendation on his behalf.
