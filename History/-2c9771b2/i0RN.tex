% \section*{Proposed Research Title}
% Finding the most connected vertices in a hidden graph via random sampling.
% \section*{Proposed Research Project Summary}
% An undirected graph is said to be hidden if the edges of the graph are not explicitly given. The problem of detecting the edges of a hidden bipartite graph has recently generated considerable interest in the database research community because of its many applications. All previous studies on this problem assume that to detect the presence of an edge between two given vertices, one must perform an \new{edge-probing query}, which returns a Boolean answer as to whether the two vertices are connected. In many real-world problems, however, such a query may not exist. Instead, we may at best receive only a \new{score} after performing the query. 

% In this project, we study the hidden bipartite graph problem, but with the additional constraint that to discover the existence of an edge, merely performing one edge-probing query is insufficient. Instead, we assume at our disposal a \new{score-probing query}, which returns the score of a vertex with respect to another vertex. Specifically, given a hidden bipartite graph $G$ between two sets of vertices $\B$ (called black vertex set) and $\W$ (called white vertex set), we aim to identify the $k$ vertices with the highest degrees from the white vertex set $\W$. An edge between two vertices, say $b\in\B$ and $w\in\W$, is established if and only if vertex $w$ receives the highest score from the score function of vertex $b$, relative to other vertices in $\W$. The challenge lies in solving this problem while keeping the number of score-probing queries required to a minimum. 
% \begin{comment}
% An edge is established only if one vertex has the highest score with respect to all vertices in another independent set of the given bipartite graph. Our aim is to identify the $k$ vertices with the highest degrees, while keeping the number of score-probing queries required to a minimum. 

% Therefore, rather than assume the availability of an edge-probing query, we instead assume at our disposal a \new{score-probing query}, which returns the score of a vertex with respect to another vertex. Specifically, given a hidden bipartite graph $G$ between two sets of vertices $\B$ (called black vertex set) and $\W$ (called white vertex set), we aim to identify the $k$ vertices with the highest degrees from the white vertex set $\W$. An edge between two vertices, say $b\in\B$ and $w\in\W$, is established if and only if vertex $w$ receives the highest score from the score function of vertex $b$, relative to other vertices in $\W$. The challenge lies in solving this problem while keeping the number of score-probing queries required to a minimum.

	% \paragraph{Abstract:} suppose there are $n$ users and $m$ items, and the preference of each user for the items is revealed only upon probing, which takes time and is therefore costly. How can we quickly discover all the frequent items that are favored individually by at least a given number of users? This new problem not only has strong connections with several well-known problems, such as the frequent item mining problem, it also finds applications in fields such as sponsored search and marketing surveys. Unlike traditional frequent item mining, however, our problem assumes no prior knowledge of users' preferences, and thus obtaining the support of an item becomes costly. Although our problem can be settled naively by probing the preferences of all $n$ users, the number of users is typically enormous, and each probing itself can also incur a prohibitive cost. 
	
	% We present a sampling algorithm that drastically reduces the number of users needed to probe to $O(\log m)$---regardless of the number of users---as long as slight inaccuracy in the output is permitted. For reasonably sized input, our algorithm needs to probe only $0.5\%$ of the users, whereas the naive approach needs to probe all of them.
