# Q1
- Let $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ be the population mean and variance, respecitvely, and $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ be a random sample from the population. 
- Prove or disprove: $\frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n(X_i - \mu)^2$ is an unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$
- Let $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ be a random sample from the geometric distribution with parameter $p$. Let $\overline{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n X_i$ and $\tilde{X} = \frac{n\overline{X}+\sqrt{n}/2}{n+\sqrt{n}}$
	- prove or disprove: $\overline{X}$ is an unbiased estimator of $1/p$.
	- prove that $\tilde{X}$ is a biased estimator of $1/p$. What $\tilde{X}$ tends to as $n\rightarrow\infty$?



(a) Two independent experiments are being conducted in which two different types of medicines are compared. Eighteen patients are using Type I and the time for them to recover, in month, is recorded on each. The same is done with Type II. Assume the time to recover is iid normal, and the population standard deviations of time to recover for both types are 1 month while the population mean times to recover for Type I and Type II are unknown but equal.
(i) Find the standard error of the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2$, where $\bar{X}_1$ and $\bar{X}_2$ are the average times to recover for samples using Types I and II, respectively.
(ii) What is the probability that the mean time to recover for the sample using Type I is larger than the sample using Type II for more than 1 month?
(iii) Suppose we do not know whether the population mean times to recover for the two types of medicine are equal or not. Based on the above sample data and the results of (a)(ii), what conclusion could you make regarding the equality of the two sample mean times to recover?
(iv) Suppose the difference in the two sample means is as small as 1 week only (i.e. $0.25$ month), what conclusion could you make regarding the equality of the two sample mean times?
(b) A metal manufacturer produces screws that have a length of $2.1$ centimetres. Assume that the distribution of the screws is iid normal with mean $2.15$ centimetres and standard deviation $0.4$ centimetres. Suppose the screws are sold in a bag of 50 pieces. Find the probability that a randomly selected bag will contain more than $30 \%$ of screws with length longer than $2.1$ centimetres.
