% good commands:
% \makeemptybox{5in}
% \makeemptybox{\fill}
% \fillwithlines{3in}
% \fillwithlines{\fill}
% vspace*{3in} # You can also use the \vspace command, the difference being that space inserted by \vspace will be deleted if it occurs at the top of a new page, whereas space inserted by \vspace* will never be deleted.
% vspace*{\stretch{1}}
% If you want to leave all the remaining space on the page blank, you should give the commands
% \vspace*{\stretch{1}}
% \newpage

% If you want to equally distribute the blank space among several questions on the page, then just put \vspace*{\stretch{1}} after each of the questions and use \newpage to end the page. You can also distribute the available space in some other ratio. For example, to give one of the questions on the page twice as much space as any of the others, put \vspace*{\stretch{2}} after that question and \vspace*{\stretch{1}} after each of the others.

\question[20]~
Let $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ be a random sample from the geometric distribution with parameter $p$. Let $$\overline{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n X_i$$ and $$\tilde{X} = \frac{n\overline{X}+\sqrt{n}/2}{n+\sqrt{n}}$$

\question[30]~
Water Supplies Department tests the drinking water of homeowners for contaminants such as zinc and iron. The zinc and iron levels in water specimens collected for a sample of 11 residents are shown in the following table. Assume that both zinc and iron levels in water specimens are normally distributed.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline Zinc (mg/L) & $1.32$ & 0 & $1.31$ & $0.92$ & $0.66$ & 3 & $1.32$ & $4.09$ & $4.45$ & 0 & $3.21$ \\
\hline Iron (mg/L) & $0.485$ & $0.222$ & $0.875$ & $0.508$ & $0.904$ & $0.221$ & $0.283$ & $0.475$ & $0.13$ & $0.22$ & $0.743$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{parts}

\part Construct a $99 \%$ confidence interval for the mean zinc level in water specimens.
\part Suppose that population standard deviation of iron level is $0.24 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$.
\begin{subparts}
  \subpart Construct a $95 \%$ confidence interval for the mean iron level in water specimens.
  \subpart For quality control purposes, we wish to estimate the mean iron level in water specimens to within $0.025 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ of its true value with a $98 \%$ confidence interval. What sample size should be used?
\end{subparts}
\part Develop an approximate $90 \%$ confidence interval for the proportion of water specimens containing more than $0.30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ of iron.
\part How many additional samples are required to ensure that, with at least 0.98 probaility, the absolute difference between the sample proportion for water specimens containing more than $0.30 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ of iron and the population proportion be less than 0.01?
\end{parts}

\question[10]
The following data represent the battery life of devices produced by two companies.

\begin{tabular}{c|rrrrrrr} 
Company & \multicolumn{7}{|c}{ Time (minutes) } \\
\hline I & 103 & 94 & 110 & 87 & 98 & \\
II & 97 & 82 & 123 & 92 & 175 & 88 & 118
\end{tabular}

Compute a $99 \%$ confidence interval for the ratio of variance of battery life by Company I to that of Company II. Assume that battery life of devices produced by two companies are approximately normally distributed. Is there edvidence to suggest that the two varainaces are equal?
