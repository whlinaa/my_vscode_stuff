Now, suppose that a collection of one stamp for each kind of stamp can be used to exchange for a gift. What is the probability that you can exchange a gift by making `n_purchases` purchases at 7-11?\n"," - Your task is to estimate the probability by repeating the whole process many times, and records how many times you are able to exchange for a gift. Finally, return the fraction of times you can exchange a gift.\n"," - Write a function to estimate the probability for the given values of `n_stamps` and `n_purchases`. Your function returns the estimated probability as output\n"," - Then, draw a graph to show how the probability varies when `n_stamps` varies.
